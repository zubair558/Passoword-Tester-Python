# Passoword-Tester-Python
The Password Strength Tester is a Python program that assesses the strength of a password based on specific criteria. To be considered strong, the password must meet the following requirements:

Length: The password must be at least 8 characters long.
Character Types: It should include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters.
Digits: At least one digit (0-9) must be included.
Special Characters: It should contain at least one special character from the set !@#$%^&*()_+[]{}|;:,.<>?/.
How it Works:

Users are prompted to input a password.
The program evaluates the password based on the criteria mentioned above.
If the password satisfies all conditions, it prints "Strong password! Good job!" and terminates.
If the password is weak, it displays "Weak password! Please choose a stronger one." and prompts the user to input a password again, providing guidance on the necessary criteria for a strong password.
The program continues to prompt the user until a strong password is provided.
This tool helps users create robust passwords by ensuring they meet essential security standards.
